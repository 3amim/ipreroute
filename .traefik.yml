description: |
  A Traefik plugin that checks incoming request IPs against a list of blocked IPs stored in Redis. If the IP exists in the list, the plugin silently reroutes the request to a specified target IP and port.
  
  This is fully transparent: the original request headers, including the Host, remain unchanged and the client does not see any redirect. 
  Supports both HTTP and HTTPS with SNI, and is designed for high-load production environments.
